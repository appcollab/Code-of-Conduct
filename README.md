This code of conduct is for a nascent collective focused on building small side projects/businesses. An essential core value we share is that we are welcoming to others and respectful.

# Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Beyond this, we seek to foster an environment in which all community members feel welcome and empowered.

This code of conduct applies to all community-run spaces and discussions, including slack, github, mailing lists, and meetups,  both online and off. Anyone and everyone who violates this code of conduct will be initially warned, then prompty sanctioned or expelled from community involvement at the discretion of the admins (currently @jbr).

Some projects or spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Geek Feminism community. More definitions of what constitutes harrasment are spelled out in the long form policy at: http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy
