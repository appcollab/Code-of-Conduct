# AppCollab
AppCollab is collective for starting small side projects/businesses. It is currently forming, and the details are emerging ;-)

# Code of Conduct

Shorter version
AppCollab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all AppCollab spaces, including slack, any mailing lists or meetups, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the admins (currently @jbr).

Some AppCollab spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Geek Feminism community. More definitions of what constitutes harrasment are spelled out in the long form policy at: http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment/Policy
